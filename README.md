# Vue.js Mail Example Application


This repo contains the code for demo mail app. Since all the codes are hard coded for more backend support there a lot of work needed to be done. 

## Getting up and Running

``` bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Serve with hot reload at http://localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production with minification
npm run build
```
